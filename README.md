# Bioinformatics: Introduction to Data, Databases and Tools
This repository contains the content for a bioinformatics course focused on introducing the fundamental concepts, applications, databases, and tools used in the field. This repository contains all material related to the course Bioinformatics (BT3040) in the Spring 2024 semester.

## Key Modules
- `Bioinformatics Fundamentals`: Understand the core concepts of bioinformatics and its role in bridging biology, computer science, and statistics.

- `Command Line & Unix Environment`: Conquer the command line, your essential tool for navigating and manipulating bioinformatics data. Learn to remotely access powerful computing resources with SSH.

- `Bioinformatics Databases`: Explore prominent sequence databases like GenBank and UniProt, which house the blueprints of life – DNA and protein sequences – from a multitude of organisms.

- `Sequence Alignment Techniques`: Master techniques for comparing and analyzing biological sequences. Learn about pairwise alignment algorithms, scoring matrices for evaluating alignments, and dynamic programming for optimal alignment.

- `Protein Sequence Analysis`: Delve into protein sequence analysis, exploring tools and techniques to understand protein function and evolution.

- `Protein Structure Demystified`:  Unravel the Protein Data Bank (PDB) - a treasure trove of protein structure information. Learn to visualize these structures in 3D with tools like PyMOL.

- `Protein Structure Prediction`:  Explore methods for predicting protein structures based on sequence information.

- `Phylogenetic Analysis`:  Become an evolutionary detective! Learn about phylogenetic analysis methods for reconstructing evolutionary relationships between organisms and building informative phylogenetic trees.

- `Bioinformatics & Programming Resources`: Discover valuable online resources for further exploration in bioinformatics and programming languages commonly used in the field.

- `Machine Learning in Bioinformatics`: Gain an introductory understanding of machine learning techniques and their applications in genome analysis.
